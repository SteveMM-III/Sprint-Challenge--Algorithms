#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - as input grows the work done grows proportionately with it


b) O(n log n) - outer loop is O(n) while inner n/2 decreases steps by half


c) O(n) - same as a

## Exercise II
Start by dropping an egg from the middle floor. If it breaks, go 1/2 way lower, if it doesn't break, go 1/2 way higher. Repeat until we reach the two floors where the egg breaks and the egg does not break.

O(log n) - dividing the input by two each time.
